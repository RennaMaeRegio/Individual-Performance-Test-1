## Let's Explore Backend Performance Testing! ðŸš€
### What's the Goal?
We're on a mission to see how well you can handle backend tasks like finding, sorting, and picking out specific courses.

### How to Get Started:
1. #### Get the Right Tools:
> Grab the MongoDB Database tool here.
> Follow the instructions to install it here.
2. #### Setting Up Your Backend:
> Use a magic command called mongoimport to bring in the course data:
 mongoimport --db mongo-test --collection courses --file courses.json --jsonArray
3. #### Let's Dive In!:
> Find all the backend courses and put them in alphabetical order.
> Pick out the names and specializations of each course.
> Look for specific courses like BSIS and BSIT from the list.
> Check to make sure the data you find is accurate.

### Tips for Your Adventure:
Make sure your MongoDB tool is installed correctly.
Be careful when running commands, so you get the right results.
Follow the steps closely to uncover the secrets of backend testing.
